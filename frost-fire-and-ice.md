# The King
* 13-time All-Star 
* 13-time All-NBA selection
* 4-time MVP
* 3-time champion
* 7 consecutive Finals appearances
## Career Averages
* 27.1 PPG 
* 7.3 RPG 
* 7.0 APG 
# Mr. Popular 
* #1 player that other players secretly want on their team
* Heralded as the greatest teammate

# Homecoming King
* decides rather secretively (not even Dwyane Wade knew until the day of) to return to the Land in 2014
* just two weeks after Irving committed to the franchise by signing a five-year extension (ends 2019)

# History repeats itself
* There is no telling where the King will go come 2018 
* Even Kobe had trouble 

# Goes against the Grain
## The superstar stacking
* CP3 joins The Beard (HOU)
* Hayward joins IT (BOS)
* Butler joins KAT (MIL)
* PG joins Russ (OKC)

# Why?

* As a young and ambitious supertar, the NBA is a once in a lifetime opportunity to etch his legacy into hardwood forever.
* He resents being the little brother and the wins weren't worth the "James sauce"
* Only following in big brother's footsteps: James is the prototype sign 
* His chance to return the favor and make a power-move that 

# Where to?

* 


# From what I've tasted of desire
# I hold with those who favor fire.
# But if it had to perish twice,
# I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice  
Is also great  
And would suffice.  data-audio-src="2.0-name.ogg">
