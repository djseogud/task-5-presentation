# Mr. Popular 
* #1 player that other players secretly want on their team
* Heralded as the greatest teammate



# Homecoming King
* decides rather secretively (not even Dwyane Wade knew until the day of) to return to the Land in 2014
* just two weeks after Irving committed to the franchise by signing a five-year extension (ends 2019)

# History repeats itself
* There is no telling where the King will go come 2018 



# The superstar stacking
# CP3 joins The Beard (HOU)
# Hayward joins IT (BOS)
# PG joins Russ (OKC)

# Why?

* As a young and ambitious supertar, the NBA is a once in a lifetime opportunity to etch his legacy into hardwood forever.
* He resents being the little brother and the wins weren't worth the "James sauce"
* Only following in big brother's footsteps: James is the prototype signee
* His chance to return the favor and make a power-move that 

# Where to?
